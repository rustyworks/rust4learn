# rust4learn
When I trying rust,

it's seems that this language is just like safe version of C.

So I think it would be better practice if I try to mimicing the C4learn project.

## How to run
Just go to the sub folder and type cargo run.

## Version
I use 1.8.0

## Note
Feel free to clone and give suggestion.
